European Union Public Licence v. 1.2

This European Union Public Licence (the 'EUPL') applies to the Work or Software (the 'Work') as provided under the terms of this Licence. Any use of the Work, other than as authorised under this Licence, is prohibited (to the extent such use is covered by a right of the copyright holder of the Work).

The Original Work is provided under the terms of this Licence when the Licensor expressly selects its application to the Work, by means of the notice required under Article 5.

3. Communication of Source Code

The Licensor shall provide the Source Code of the Work when distributing or communicating it as Executable Code. Where only the Executable Code is received, the Licensee can request the Source Code from the Licensor, who must provide it within a reasonable period of time and at no more than the cost of distribution.

4. Limitations on copyright

Nothing in this Licence is intended to deprive You of any rights you may have under applicable law (e.g. exceptions, limitations, or compulsory licensing schemes). 

5. Obligations of the Licensee

The Licensee who distributes or communicates the Work or Derivative Works shall:

- Provide the Source Code or indicate where it can be accessed.

6. Chain of Authorship

Any time the Licensee communicates the Work, they must include an appropriate notice of authorship, ensure provenance is kept intact, and provide a clear description of the modifications made (if any).

7. Compatibility with other Licences

The Licence allows the Work to be combined with or reused in projects under the terms of compatible licenses, listed at:
https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/collection/eupl/compatible-licences

In this case, the resulting work may be distributed under the terms of that compatible licence, provided the original Work remains subject to this Licence.

8. Disclaimer of Warranty

The Work is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the Work is with You. Should the Work prove defective, You assume the cost of all necessary servicing, repair, or correction.

9. Liability

Except in the case of wilful misconduct or damages directly caused to natural persons, the Licensor shall not be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising out of the use or inability to use the Work.

10. Termination

The Licence and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to comply with its terms. Such termination shall not affect the rights granted to others, or their rights to use the Work.

11. Miscellaneous

This Licence shall be governed by the law of the European Union country where the Licensor resides or has their registered office. Failing this, it shall be governed by Belgian law.

12. Interpretation

The provisions of this Licence shall be interpreted in a manner that most closely approximates the common intention of the parties, and to make the Licence enforceable and effective.
